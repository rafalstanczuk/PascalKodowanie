KODOWRS2.EXE - Analysis and Reconstruction
==========================================

File Information:
- File: KODOWRS2.EXE
- Size: 8,576 bytes (560 bytes larger than KodowRS.exe)
- Type: MS-DOS Executable (MZ format)
- Compiler: Borland Pascal (1983-1992)
- Date: June 3, 2003

Analysis Based on String Extraction:
====================================

Key Differences from KodowRS.exe:
1. **Binary Encoding Algorithm**: Contains binary patterns (00000000, 00000001, etc.)
2. **Larger File Size**: 8,576 bytes vs 8,016 bytes (560 bytes more)
3. **Enhanced Encoding**: Uses binary representation for encoding
4. **Same User Interface**: Identical Polish menu system
5. **Same Author**: Rafał Stańczuk (rafalsrs@wp.pl)

Binary Pattern Analysis:
========================

The executable contains binary patterns from 00000000 to 01011111:
- 00000000 to 00011111 (0-31 in binary)
- 00100000 to 00111111 (32-63 in binary)  
- 01000000 to 01011111 (64-95 in binary)

This suggests the encoding algorithm uses:
1. **Binary Representation**: Characters are converted to binary strings
2. **Pattern Matching**: Uses predefined binary patterns
3. **Enhanced Security**: More complex than simple character shifting

Expected Features:
==================

1. **Binary Encoding**: Characters converted to binary representation
2. **Pattern-Based Encryption**: Uses binary patterns for encoding
3. **Same User Interface**: Identical menu system to KodowRS.exe
4. **Enhanced Security**: More complex encoding algorithm
5. **File I/O**: Same file handling as original

Reconstruction Strategy:
========================

Since this is version 2 with binary encoding:
1. **Binary Conversion Functions**: Convert characters to/from binary
2. **Pattern Matching**: Use binary patterns for encoding
3. **Enhanced Algorithm**: More sophisticated than simple character shifting
4. **Same Interface**: Maintain identical user interface
5. **Binary String Handling**: Process binary representations

The reconstruction will implement:
- Binary string conversion
- Pattern-based encoding/decoding
- Enhanced security algorithm
- Same user interface as original
- Binary pattern matching system
