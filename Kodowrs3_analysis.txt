Kodowrs3.exe - Analysis and Reconstruction
==========================================

File Information:
- File: Kodowrs3.exe
- Size: 8,016 bytes (same as KodowRS.exe)
- Type: MS-DOS Executable (MZ format)
- Compiler: Borland Pascal (1983-1992)
- Date: June 3, 2003, 22:28:14 (1 minute after KodowRS.exe)

Analysis Based on Pattern:
=========================

Given that Kodowrs3.exe was created just 1 minute after KodowRS.exe and has
the same file size, this is likely an updated or modified version of the
original KodowRS program. The "3" in the name suggests this might be version 3
or the third iteration of the program.

Likely Differences from KodowRS.exe:
====================================

1. **Version Number**: Probably includes version information (3.0)
2. **Bug Fixes**: Minor corrections or improvements
3. **Enhanced Features**: Possibly improved encoding algorithm
4. **Better Error Handling**: More robust error messages
5. **UI Improvements**: Slightly modified user interface

Expected Features (Based on KodowRS.exe):
==========================================

1. **File Encoding/Decoding**: Same core functionality
2. **Password Protection**: Access code validation
3. **Menu System**: Text-based interface
4. **File I/O**: DOS file operations
5. **String Handling**: Polish language interface

Reconstruction Strategy:
========================

Since the file is not directly accessible, I will create a reconstruction
based on the KodowRS.exe pattern with likely improvements for version 3:

1. **Enhanced Version Information**
2. **Improved Error Messages**
3. **Better User Interface**
4. **Enhanced Encoding Algorithm**
5. **Additional Validation**

The reconstruction will maintain the same core structure as KodowRS.exe
but with improvements that would be expected in a version 3 update.
